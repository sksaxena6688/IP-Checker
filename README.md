## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters an IPv4 address  
2. Application validates format  
3. Real geolocation data fetched from API  
4. Identity-style data generated locally  
5. Results displayed in structured layout

## 📦 Data Sources

Geolocation & network metadata are retrieved from:

https://ipapi.co/

Identity-related fields are **purely mock data** generated on the client side.

## ⚠ Important Notice

IP geolocation provides **approximate location data only**.

Exact physical addresses or real user identities **cannot be derived from an IP address**.

All identity-style fields shown in this tool are randomly generated for UI / demonstration purposes.
